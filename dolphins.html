    <h2>About Dolphins</h2>
    <p>
        Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals known for their playful behavior and exceptional swimming abilities. They belong to the family Delphinidae, which includes several species such as the bottlenose dolphin, common dolphin, and orca (also known as killer whale).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        Dolphins have streamlined bodies that are well adapted for swimming. They have a curved dorsal fin on their backs and a horizontal tail fin called a fluke. Their skin is smooth and usually gray or light blue in color.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
    <p>
        Dolphins can be found in oceans and seas around the world. They prefer coastal areas but can also inhabit deeper waters. They are highly social animals and often live in groups called pods.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Feeding Habits</h2>
    <p>
        Dolphins are carnivorous and primarily feed on fish and squid. They are excellent hunters and use echolocation, a system of sending and receiving sound waves, to locate their prey.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>
        Dolphins face various threats, including pollution, habitat degradation, and entanglement in fishing gear. Some species are endangered or vulnerable due to human activities. Conservation efforts aim to protect dolphin populations and their habitats.
